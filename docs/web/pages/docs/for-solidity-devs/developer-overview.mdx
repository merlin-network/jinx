# Launching Your Smart Contracts on Jinx Ethereum

The Purpose of this section is to provide information that will help you launch your smart contracts on Jinx Ethereum. 
You will read how to use various EVM development tools with Jinx Ethereum along with examples. We will show you how to connect to the network, 
how to use your existing projects on Jinx Ethereum, as well as any additional information relating to Jinx Ethereum's new features.

## Jinx Ethereum EVM 

Jinx' EVM is designed to be as interoperable with go-ethereum as possible, which means that any tool that works with [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/) can also be used to interact with Jinx Ethereum. The EVM is still responsible for executing Solidity smart contracts and managing the chain's data structures and blocks. By using CometBFT's consensus protocol and the Cosmos-SDK, Jinx Ethereum is able to access Cosmos-SDK properties through [precompiles](../building-precompiles/intro-to-precompiles), while also remaining compatible with all Ethereum Solidity smart contracts.

It's important to note that Jinx' EVM is interoperable with its Cosmos-SDK Application Layer. This means that Smart Contract Developers have access to base Cosmos-SDK modules through the EVM. With this new feature, developers can access Cosmos features like on-chain governance, the IBC protocol, and various other Cosmos-SDK modules.

From the perspective of a Smart Contract, it will run in the same way as it would on Ethereum, but with additional contract addresses that provide access to the chain's Cosmos-SDK modules.

## Interacting With Stateful Precompiles
Jinx Ethereum's Stateful Precompiles can be interacted with like any 
other contract deployed on the EVM in Solidity. All you need is a
contract address and an ABI which you can find [here](../precompile-overview).

For an example contract that interacts with Jinx Ethereum's staking precompile you
can reference our [Liquid Staking Example](https://github.com/berachain/jinx-precompile-dapp-examples).
## Accessing Jinx' EVM

### Running a local Jinx Ethereum Development environment
For a guide on how to run a local development environment, please refer to the [Local Machine](../running-a-node/running-locally) section.

### Smart Contract Development
There are various existing tools that can be used for smart contract development.
Below are some of the most popular tools that can be used to develop smart contracts on Jinx Ethereum.
